You cannot pronounce the name of this repository, which is fine because you also probably shouldn't use it.

This is a hacked-up (really) FUSE filesystem in python2 (told you) which maps the canonical conventions I use for storing RISC OS files on my fileserver (basically RPCEmu hostfs conventions) to the conventions used by the Pi Econet Bridge (which uses xattrs).

It's niche, bad software, and probably has no purpose for anyone except me.
